**Project Title: Plant Disease Predictor**

**Overview**

This project aims to provide a tool for identifying plant diseases using image-based diagnosis. The core components are:

* **Dataset:** A collection of 50,000 images encompassing various plant diseases.
* **Image Preprocessing:** Pipelines to prepare images for model input (resizing, normalization, etc.).
* **CNN Model:** A Convolutional Neural Network trained to classify plant diseases from images.
* **Streamlit App:** A user-friendly web interface for uploading plant images and receiving disease predictions.

**Prerequisites**

* Python 3.x 
* Libraries:
    * TensorFlow or PyTorch (for CNN model)
    * OpenCV (for image processing)
    * Streamlit (for web app)
    * NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib (data manipulation and visualization)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/plant-disease-predictor
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   env\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Data Preparation**

* The dataset is assumed to be organized into subfolders, each representing a disease class.
* If your dataset is not pre-organized, include a data preparation script or instructions.

**Model Training**

1. **Define your CNN architecture:** Design your model using TensorFlow/PyTorch layers.
2. **Train the model:**
   ```python
   # Example TensorFlow code snippet:
   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) 
   model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=20, batch_size=32) 
   ```
3. **Save the trained model:**
    ```python
    model.save('plant_disease_model.h5')
    ```

**Web App Development (Streamlit)**

1. **Create app.py:**
   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   import numpy as np
   from PIL import Image 
   from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model

   model = load_model('plant_disease_model.h5') 
   # ... (code to handle image upload, preprocessing, prediction display)
   ```
2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

**Usage**

1. Start the Streamlit app.
2. Upload an image of a plant leaf.
3. The app will process the image and display the predicted disease.

**Future Improvements**

* Expand the dataset for more plant species and diseases.
* Incorporate treatment recommendations.
* Optimize the model's performance.
